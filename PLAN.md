# PDF Scan Service - Implementation Plan

## Overview
A web service that accepts PDF uploads, scans them for sensitive information, stores findings in Clickhouse, and provides a query endpoint for results.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Components
1. **Web Server**: FastAPI/Flask for HTTP endpoints
2. **PDF Scanner**: Pluggable interface with regex-based initial implementation
3. **Database**: Pluggable interface with in-memory prototype and Clickhouse production implementation
4. **File Storage**: Local filesystem (temp storage, cleaned after scan)

### Sensitive Data Patterns (v1)
- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
- Email Addresses
- (Extensible pattern list)

### Key Design Decisions
- **Interface-driven design**: Allows swapping implementations without changing business logic
- **Incremental approach**: Each phase produces a working system
- **Schema-first for Clickhouse**: Design real schema early to avoid interface mismatches
- **Synchronous initially**: Can add async processing later if needed

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Models & Schema Design
**Status**: üü¢ Completed (2025-10-27)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Define data models for:
  - Upload metadata (document ID, filename, upload time, status)
  - Findings (document ID, finding type, content snippet, location, confidence)
  - Performance metrics (operation type, duration, timestamp)
- [x] Design Clickhouse schema:
  - `documents` table (document metadata)
  - `findings` table (scan results)
  - `metrics` table (performance data)
  - Define primary keys, sorting keys, partitioning strategy
- [x] Document expected API contracts

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ Schema documented and reviewed for Clickhouse compatibility

**Deliverables**:
- `src/pdf_scan/models.py`: Python data models using dataclasses
- `docs/schema.md`: Clickhouse schema with tables, indexes, and query patterns
- `docs/api.md`: Complete API contracts for all endpoints

---

### Phase 2: Web Server with Upload Endpoint
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Choose web framework (FastAPI recommended for async + auto docs)
- [ ] Implement `/upload` endpoint:
  - Accept multipart/form-data with PDF file
  - Validate file type (PDF only)
  - Validate file size (set reasonable limit, e.g., 10MB)
  - Generate unique document ID
  - Save to temp storage
  - Return document ID and upload status
- [ ] Basic error handling:
  - Invalid file type
  - File too large
  - Malformed requests
- [ ] Add metric collection hooks (timing, counters)
- [ ] Create basic health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [ ] Manual testing with curl/Postman

**Success Criteria**: Can upload valid PDF, get document ID back; invalid uploads rejected with proper errors

---

### Phase 3: Database Interface with In-Memory Implementation
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Define `DatabaseInterface` abstract class with methods:
  - `store_document(doc_id, filename, upload_time, status)` 
  - `store_finding(doc_id, finding_type, content, location, confidence)`
  - `get_findings(doc_id)` - returns list of findings for a document
  - `get_all_findings(limit, offset)` - paginated findings
  - `store_metric(operation, duration, timestamp)`
- [ ] Implement `InMemoryDatabase` class:
  - Use Python dicts/lists for storage
  - Implement all interface methods
  - Data persists only during runtime (acceptable for testing)
- [ ] Unit tests for in-memory implementation

**Success Criteria**: In-memory database passes all unit tests; data can be written and retrieved

---

### Phase 4: PDF Scanner Interface with Regex Implementation
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Define `PDFScannerInterface` abstract class:
  - `scan_pdf(file_path)` - returns list of findings
- [ ] Implement `RegexPDFScanner` class:
  - Extract text from PDF (use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber)
  - Apply regex patterns for sensitive data:
    - SSN: `\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}` or `\d{9}`
    - Credit Card: `\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}`
    - Email: standard email regex
    - Phone: various US phone formats
  - Return findings with:
    - Type (SSN, CC, email, etc.)
    - Content snippet (redacted or masked)
    - Location (page number, approx position if available)
    - Confidence (1.0 for regex matches)
- [ ] Handle errors:
  - Corrupt PDFs
  - Password-protected PDFs
  - Empty PDFs
- [ ] Unit tests with sample PDFs

**Success Criteria**: Scanner correctly identifies test patterns in sample PDFs; handles errors gracefully

**Known Limitations**:
- Cannot detect sensitive data in images/scanned documents (no OCR)
- Regex may have false positives (e.g., random number sequences)
- Pattern list is not exhaustive

---

### Phase 5: Integration & End-to-End Testing
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Wire components together:
  - Upload endpoint saves file and stores document in DB
  - Trigger PDF scan after upload
  - Store findings in DB
  - Store performance metrics
- [ ] Implement upload flow:
  ```
  1. Receive PDF upload
  2. Validate and save to temp storage
  3. Store document record (status: processing)
  4. Scan PDF for sensitive data
  5. Store findings in DB
  6. Update document status (status: completed/failed)
  7. Clean up temp file
  8. Return response
  ```
- [ ] Error handling for each step
- [ ] End-to-end tests:
  - Upload PDF with known sensitive data
  - Verify findings stored correctly
  - Verify metrics captured
- [ ] Performance testing (baseline with in-memory DB)

**Success Criteria**: Complete upload-to-storage flow works; findings are correctly stored and retrievable

---

### Phase 6: Findings Endpoint
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `/findings/<document_id>` endpoint:
  - GET request returns findings for specific document
  - Return JSON with findings list
  - Handle non-existent document IDs (404)
- [ ] Implement `/findings` endpoint (optional):
  - GET request with pagination (limit, offset)
  - Returns findings across all documents
  - Useful for admin/monitoring
- [ ] Response format:
  ```json
  {
    "document_id": "...",
    "filename": "...",
    "upload_time": "...",
    "status": "completed",
    "findings": [
      {
        "type": "SSN",
        "location": "page 2",
        "confidence": 1.0
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- [ ] Integration tests for findings endpoint

**Success Criteria**: Can query findings via HTTP; response format is correct and complete

---

### Phase 7: Clickhouse Implementation
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Clickhouse:
  - Docker container for development
  - Connection configuration
- [ ] Implement `ClickhouseDatabase` class:
  - Implement all `DatabaseInterface` methods
  - Create tables if not exist
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent injection
  - Connection pooling
- [ ] Data migration (if needed):
  - Not applicable for fresh start
  - Document any migration needs for future
- [ ] Configuration:
  - Environment variables for connection string
  - Fallback to in-memory if Clickhouse unavailable (dev mode)
- [ ] Integration tests with real Clickhouse instance
- [ ] Performance comparison with in-memory implementation

**Success Criteria**: Application works with Clickhouse; data persists across restarts; performance acceptable

**Clickhouse-Specific Considerations**:
- Choose appropriate engine (e.g., MergeTree)
- Define ORDER BY for query optimization
- Consider partitioning by date for metrics table
- Set up retention policies if needed

---

### Phase 8: Performance Metrics Enhancement
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Enhance metric collection (hooks should exist from Phase 2):
  - Upload endpoint: request duration, file size
  - PDF scan: scan duration, number of findings
  - Database operations: query duration
  - Overall request processing time
- [ ] Implement `/metrics` endpoint:
  - Return recent metrics in JSON
  - Optionally support Prometheus format
- [ ] Add metric dashboarding (optional):
  - Grafana + Clickhouse
  - Basic SQL queries for common metrics
- [ ] Performance analysis:
  - Identify bottlenecks
  - Optimize slow operations
  - Document performance characteristics

**Success Criteria**: Metrics are collected and queryable; performance bottlenecks identified

- [ ] Async processing with job queue (Celery, RQ)
- [ ] OCR for scanned PDFs
- [ ] ML-based sensitive data detection
- [ ] User authentication & authorization
