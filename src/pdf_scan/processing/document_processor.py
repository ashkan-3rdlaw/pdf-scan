        Process an uploaded PDF document.
        
        This is a skeleton implementation that:
        1. Creates a document record
        2. Saves to temporary storage
        3. Cleans up (will be kept for scanning in Phase 5)
        
        In Phase 5, this will be enhanced to:
        - Store document in database
        - Trigger PDF scanning
        - Store findings
        - Update document status
